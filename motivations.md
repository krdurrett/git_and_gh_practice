I've been in pharmacy for 17 years.
It has become increasingly toxic.
I could no longer work in the healthcare field, so much of our jobs are dictated by insurance companies.
I  wasn't helping people anymore, just a cog in the wheel of making my company more $$.
I am excited about my potential in the tech industry. I feel like I can really create and enact some change in the industry.
